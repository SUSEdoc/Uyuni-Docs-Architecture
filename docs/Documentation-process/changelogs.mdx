# Changelog system improvement project

**Project Status:** Planning Phase  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Timeline:** TBD  

---

## Current Changelog Process

Changelogs are **required** when we package the documentation. To make it easier to keep track of the changes we have made to various versions of the documentation during the development period, we maintain a plain text `.changelog` file at the top level of the docs repository.

### When to Create Changelog Entries

Not all changes you make require a changelog entry. Create a changelog entry if:

- **Large changes**: The change is relatively significant (such as a restructure, or if you have moved or renamed content)
- **New features**: The change is related to a new feature in the product
- **Bug fixes**: The change resolves a bug and you have an associated BSC number (regardless of how large or small the change is)

### Writing Guidelines

Be **concise** in your changelog entries, but ensure they make sense to a reader. Strive for parallelism in entries where possible, using the syntax:

**`<verbed> <noun> in <book name> (bsc#1234567)`**

#### Examples:

```
- Updated Foo chapter in Installation Guide for readability
- Documented Bar feature in Administration Guide  
- Fixed error in Bat section of Upgrade Guide (bsc#1234567)
```

### Official Guidelines

For comprehensive guidelines on writing changelogs, refer to the [openSUSE Creating a Changes File documentation](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Creating_a_changes_file_(RPM)#Changelog_section_.28.25changelog.29).

### PR Review Checklist

When reviewing pull requests, remember to consider the changelog entry:

- ✅ **Does this change need a changelog?**
- ✅ **Does this entry make sense to a reader?**
- ✅ **Does this entry contain the correct BSC number?**
- ✅ **Does this entry use correct spelling and grammar?**
- ✅ **Could this entry be written more simply?**

### Important Notes

:::warning Commit Requirements
Always ensure your changelog entry is committed in the **same PR** as the change it relates to. This ensures that your changelog entry is backported to the correct feature branch along with the change, and is included correctly at packaging time.

## Project Overview

This document outlines a proposed improvement to the changelog system within the `uyuni-docs` repository to enhance release information tracking, artifact generation, and overall communication of changes across Uyuni releases.

The current changelog approach lacks consistency, automation, and integration with our documentation workflow. This project aims to establish a robust, maintainable changelog system that serves both developers and end users.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Challenges

- **Inconsistent Format**: Changelog entries vary in structure and detail level
- **Manual Process**: Changes require manual compilation and formatting
- **Limited Automation**: No automated generation from Git history or PR metadata
- **Poor Integration**: Changelog updates are disconnected from documentation builds
- **Release Artifacts**: Limited integration with release packaging and distribution
- **Version Tracking**: Insufficient linking between documentation versions and software releases

### Current Workflow Gaps

1. **Change Detection**: No systematic way to identify documentation-impacting changes
2. **Categorization**: Lack of standardized change categories (features, fixes, deprecations)
3. **Cross-referencing**: Limited links between changelog entries and related documentation
4. **Automation**: Manual effort required for each release cycle
5. **Stakeholder Communication**: Inconsistent messaging for different audiences

---

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives

1. **Standardized Format**: Establish consistent changelog entry structure
2. **Automation Integration**: Implement automated changelog generation workflows
3. **Release Artifact Enhancement**: Improve changelog inclusion in release packages
4. **Documentation Integration**: Link changelog entries to relevant documentation sections
5. **Multi-audience Support**: Tailor changelog content for different user types

### Success Metrics

- Reduced manual effort in changelog preparation
- Increased consistency across releases
- Improved developer and user experience with change communication
- Better integration between documentation and software release processes
- Enhanced traceability of changes and their documentation impact

---

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### Technical Components

#### 1. Changelog Format Standardization

```markdown
## [Version] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- New features and capabilities
- New documentation sections

### Changed
- Modifications to existing functionality
- Updated documentation content

### Deprecated
- Features marked for future removal
- Documentation sections to be retired

### Removed
- Deleted features
- Removed documentation

### Fixed
- Bug fixes
- Documentation corrections

### Security
- Security-related changes
- Documentation security updates
```

#### 2. Automation Workflow

- **Git Integration**: Extract changes from commit messages and PR descriptions
- **Label-based Categorization**: Use GitHub labels to categorize changes automatically
- **Template Enforcement**: Standardized PR templates with changelog information
- **Release Integration**: Automatic changelog generation during release process

#### 3. Documentation Integration

- **Cross-references**: Link changelog entries to affected documentation pages
- **Version Tracking**: Maintain changelog per documentation version
- **Release Notes**: Generate user-facing release notes from changelog data
- **Archive Management**: Historical changelog access and searchability
