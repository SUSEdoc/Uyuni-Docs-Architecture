# Agile methodology for documentation

**Process Type:** Team Methodology  
**Applies to:** Uyuni documentation team operations  
**Framework:** Docs-as-Code with Agile practices  
**Review Cycle:** Continuous improvement through retrospectives  

---

## Overview

The Uyuni documentation team operates using an agile methodology centered around a **docs-as-code** approach. This methodology treats documentation with the same rigor and processes as software development, ensuring quality, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

Our agile framework combines:
- **GitHub-based planning** for transparency and tracking
- **Collaborative workflows** for knowledge sharing
- **Iterative delivery** of documentation improvements

---

## Core Principles

### Docs-as-Code Philosophy

**Version Control:**
- All documentation stored in Git repositories
- Changes tracked through pull requests and commits
- Branching strategies align with software development practices

**Collaboration:**
- Peer review processes for all documentation changes
- Shared ownership and collective responsibility
- Cross-functional collaboration with development teams

**Automation:**
- Continuous integration for documentation builds
- Automated testing and validation
- Deployment pipelines for documentation delivery

**Quality Assurance:**
- Systematic review processes
- Consistency through style guides and templates
- Regular quality audits and improvements

## Meeting Cadence and Structure

### Daily Standups (Slack-based)

**Format:** Asynchronous Slack communication  
**Frequency:** Daily  
**Purpose:** Quick status updates and coordination

**Structure:**
- **What did you work on yesterday?**
- **What are you working on today?** 
- **Any blockers or impediments?**
- **Any help needed from the team?**

**Benefits:**
- Maintains team awareness without disrupting deep work
- Flexible timing across time zones
- Written record for reference
- Quick identification of blockers

### Weekly Retrospectives

**Schedule:** Every Thursday  
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes  
**Participants:** Full Uyuni/MLM team

**Agenda:**
1. **What went well this week?** (5-10 minutes)
2. **What could be improved?** (10-15 minutes)
3. **Action items from previous retrospective** (5-10 minutes)
4. **New action items and owners** (10-15 minutes)
5. **Process improvements** (10-15 minutes)

**Outcomes:**
- Continuous process improvement
- Team alignment and communication
- Issue identification and resolution
- Culture of learning and adaptation

### Biweekly Team Review Meetings

**Schedule:** Every two weeks  
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes  
**Participants:** Documentation team + stakeholders

**Purpose:**
- Review completed work and deliverables
- Discuss upcoming priorities and planning
- Coordinate with other teams and projects
- Share knowledge and best practices

**Agenda:**
1. **Sprint review** - Completed work demonstration (20-30 minutes)
2. **Metrics and analytics** - Team performance and project status (10-15 minutes)
3. **Upcoming work** - Next sprint planning discussion (20-30 minutes)
4. **Stakeholder feedback** - Input from product and development teams (10-15 minutes)
5. **Team updates** - Process changes and announcements (5-10 minutes)

### Core Team Meetings

**Schedule:** As needed, typically weekly (Wednesday)  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes  
**Participants:** Core team leads and key contributors

**Focus Areas:**
- Strategic planning and roadmap alignment
- Resource allocation and capacity planning
- Cross-team coordination and dependencies
- Escalation and decision-making for complex issues
