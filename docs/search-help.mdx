# Using Search Effectively

## Search Options Available

This documentation site provides two different search experiences, each designed for different use cases:

### 1. Quick Search (Popup - Top Right Corner)

**How to access:** Click the search icon or press `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+K` (Mac)

**What it shows:** 
- **Content-level results** - Individual paragraphs, sections, and text matches
- **Real-time suggestions** as you type
- **Quick navigation** to specific content sections

**Best for:**
- Finding specific information quickly
- Locating particular concepts or terms
- Getting immediate answers without leaving your current page

**Example:** Searching for "container" shows 4,283 individual text matches across all documentation

### 2. Full Search Page

**How to access:** Click "Show all X results" in the popup search, or navigate to the search page directly

**What it shows:**
- **Document-level results** - Complete pages/documents that contain your search terms
- **Organized by relevance** with document titles and snippets
- **Browse-friendly format** for exploring related topics

**Best for:**
- Exploring topics comprehensively
- Finding all documents related to a subject
- Understanding the scope of coverage on a topic

**Example:** Searching for "container" shows 89 documents that discuss containers

## Search Tips

### Getting Better Results

1. **Use specific terms** - "podman container setup" vs just "setup"
2. **Try different keywords** - "documentation" vs "docs" vs "guide"
3. **Use quotes for exact phrases** - "uyuni-docs-helper" 
4. **Combine terms** - "git branch workflow"

### Understanding Result Counts

- **High numbers** (1000+) = Many content matches, try more specific terms
- **Low numbers** (10-50) = Focused results, good for comprehensive reading
- **Zero results** = Try synonyms or broader terms

### Search Behavior Notes

**Why search results may vary:**
- The popup search indexes every paragraph and section
- The search page groups results by document
- Some content may be indexed differently than others

**If you can't find what you're looking for:**
1. Try the other search method (popup vs page)
2. Use different keywords or synonyms
3. Check the navigation menu for related sections
4. Browse the category pages for your topic

## Search Index Information

**Index updates:** The search index is rebuilt weekly, so very recent changes may not appear immediately in search results.

**Content coverage:** The search includes all English documentation pages but excludes:
- Translation pages (de, es, fr, ja, zh-Hans)
- The main homepage 
- Search pages themselves

**Technical details:** This site uses Algolia DocSearch for fast, relevant search results across all documentation content.
