# Contributing to Uyuni documentation

**Repository:** https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-docs  
**Contribution Model:** Fork-based with optional direct access  
**Review Requirements:** Technical SME + Documentation team approval  

---

## Prerequisites

### Required Setup

**GitHub Account:**
- Active GitHub account with proper profile setup
- Two-factor authentication enabled (recommended)
- SSH keys or personal access tokens configured

**Git Configuration:**
```bash
# Configure your identity
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Configure default branch behavior
git config --global init.defaultBranch master
git config --global pull.ff only
```

### Commit Signing Requirements

**Commit signing with GPG or SSH key is mandatory.** Verified commits ensure authenticity and are required for all contributions.

**Setup Options:**

**GPG Key Signing:**
```bash
# Generate a GPG key (if you don't have one)
gpg --full-generate-key

# List your GPG keys
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

# Configure Git to use your GPG key
git config --global user.signingkey <your-key-id>
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

**SSH Key Signing:**
```bash
# Configure Git to use SSH signing
git config --global gpg.format ssh
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

**Resources:**

## First-Time Contribution Setup

### Method 1: Contributing Using a Fork (Recommended)

**Step 1: Fork the Repository**
1. Navigate to https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-docs
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination

**Step 2: Clone Your Fork**
```bash
# Clone your forked repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/uyuni-docs.git
cd uyuni-docs
```

**Step 3: Configure Remotes**
```bash
# Verify your origin remote (should point to your fork)
git remote -v

# Add the upstream repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-docs.git

# Verify both remotes are configured
git remote -v
# Should show:
# origin    https://github.com/<your-username>/uyuni-docs.git (fetch)
# origin    https://github.com/<your-username>/uyuni-docs.git (push)
# upstream  https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-docs.git (fetch)
# upstream  https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-docs.git (push)
```

**Step 4: Set Up Master Branch**
```bash
# Switch to master branch
git checkout master

# Fetch latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream changes into your local master
git merge upstream/master

# Push updated master to your fork
git push origin master
```

### Method 2: Contributing With Direct Write Access

**For team members with repository write access:**

```bash
# Clone the repository directly
git clone https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-docs.git
cd uyuni-docs

# Switch to master branch
git checkout master

# Verify you're on the correct branch
git branch
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Creating Feature Branches

**Always create feature branches for your work:**

```bash
# Ensure you're on an updated master branch
git checkout master
git fetch upstream  # (for forks) or git fetch --all (for direct access)
git merge upstream/master  # (for forks) or git pull --ff-only (for direct access)

# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/update-readme-improvements

# Alternative descriptive branch names:
# git checkout -b fix/broken-links-chapter-3
# git checkout -b docs/new-installation-guide
# git checkout -b update/api-documentation
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

**Use descriptive, lowercase branch names with hyphens:**

- `feature/description-of-feature`
- `fix/description-of-fix`
- `docs/description-of-documentation`
- `update/description-of-update`

**Examples:**
- `feature/salt-master-configuration`
- `fix/broken-links-installation-guide`
- `docs/api-reference-channels`
- `update/system-requirements-suse15`

### Making Changes

**Development Best Practices:**

1. **Make focused, logical changes** related to a single issue or improvement
2. **Test your changes locally** before committing
3. **Follow documentation style guides** and existing conventions
4. **Keep commits atomic** - one logical change per commit

**Commit Process:**
```bash
# Stage specific files (preferred over git add .)
git add path/to/changed/file1.md path/to/changed/file2.md

# Or stage all changes (use with caution)
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message (will be signed automatically)
git commit -m "Add installation steps for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP4

- Include package repository configuration
- Add firewall configuration requirements  
- Update system requirements table"

# Verify your commit is signed
git log --show-signature -1
```

### Commit Message Standards

**Format:**
```
Short summary (50 chars or less)

Longer description if needed, wrapping at 72 characters. 
Explain what and why, not how. Use bullet points if helpful:

- First improvement or change
- Second improvement or change
- Third improvement or change

Fixes #123
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Added" or "Adding")
- Capitalize first letter of summary
- No period at end of summary
- Leave blank line between summary and description
- Reference issues with "Fixes #123" or "Closes #123"

---

## Pull Request Process

### Pushing Your Branch

```bash
# Push your feature branch to your fork (first time)
git push --set-upstream origin feature/your-branch-name

# Subsequent pushes (after the upstream is set)
git push
```

### Creating a Pull Request

**Step 1: Navigate to GitHub**
- Go to your fork on GitHub
- GitHub will often show a banner suggesting you create a PR
- Or navigate to the upstream repository and click "New Pull Request"

**Step 2: Configure Your PR**

**Title Guidelines:**
- Clear, descriptive summary of changes
- Prefix with `[WIP]` if work is incomplete
- Examples:
  - `Add Salt configuration examples for channel management`
  - `[WIP] Update installation guide for containerized deployments`
  - `Fix broken cross-references in API documentation`

**Description Template:**
```markdown

## Ongoing Contributions

### Keeping Your Fork Synchronized

**Essential for avoiding conflicts - do this before starting new work:**

```bash
# Switch to master branch
git checkout master

# Fetch latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream changes (fast-forward only)
git merge upstream/master

# Push updated master to your fork
git push origin master
```

### For Direct Access Contributors

```bash
# Switch to master branch
git checkout master

# Fetch all remote branches and tags
git fetch --all

# Update master with latest changes (fast-forward only)
git pull --ff-only

# Clean up merged branches (optional)
git branch --merged | grep -v master | xargs -n 1 git branch -d
```

### Starting New Work

**Always start from an updated master:**

```bash
# Ensure master is current (see synchronization steps above)
git checkout master

# Create new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

# Begin your work...
```

---

## Best Practices

### Workflow Efficiency

**Commit Early and Often:**
- Make small, logical commits during development
- Push work-in-progress branches regularly
- Use Draft PRs for ongoing work visibility

**Stay Synchronized:**
- Update your master branch daily
- Rebase feature branches when needed to avoid conflicts
- Communicate with team about potentially conflicting work

### Quality Assurance

**Before Submitting:**
- [ ] Documentation builds successfully
- [ ] All links function correctly
- [ ] Spelling and grammar checked
- [ ] Code examples tested (if applicable)
- [ ] Follows style guide conventions
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive

**Collaboration:**
- Communicate early about significant changes
- Ask for early feedback on complex work
- Coordinate with SMEs for technical content
- Update related documentation when making changes

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

**Merge Conflicts:**
```bash
# Update your master branch first
git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master

# Rebase your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-branch
git rebase master

# Resolve conflicts in your editor, then:
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

**Unsigned Commits:**
```bash
# Sign previous commit
git commit --amend --no-edit -S

# Or sign all commits in current branch
git rebase --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit -S' master
```

**Wrong Branch:**
```bash
# Move uncommitted changes to correct branch
git stash
git checkout correct-branch
git stash pop

# Move committed changes to new branch
git checkout -b correct-branch
git checkout wrong-branch
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # removes last commit from wrong branch
```
